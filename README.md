# Fake-News-Detection
This project is an AI-powered solution to detect and classify fake news using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Built in Jupyter Notebook, the project leverages machine learning models to analyze and predict whether a given news article is real or fake.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess textual data, including tokenization, stemming, and vectorization.
Machine Learning Models: Implement algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or advanced models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting for classification.
Performance Metrics: Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
Scalable and Modular: Easy-to-extend pipeline for experimenting with different datasets and models.
Interactive Visualizations: Visualize results and data trends using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, SpaCy
Notebook Environment: Jupyter Notebook
Installation and Usage

Clone the repository
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model or test on sample data.
Dataset
The project uses publicly available fake news datasets such as:

Fake and Real News Dataset
Or any custom dataset (details provided in the notebook).
Future Enhancements
Integration of deep learning models like LSTM and Transformer-based architectures (e.g., BERT).
Real-time fake news detection API or web application.
Incorporate multilingual support for detecting fake news across different languages.
