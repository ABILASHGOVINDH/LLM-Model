# LLM-Model


Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess textual data, including tokenization, stemming, and vectorization.
Machine Learning Models: Implement algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or advanced models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting for classification.
Performance Metrics: Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
Scalable and Modular: Easy-to-extend pipeline for experimenting with different datasets and models.
Interactive Visualizations: Visualize results and data trends using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:Tensorflow
Notebook Environment: Jupyter Notebook
Installation and Usage

Clone the repository
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model or test on sample data.
Dataset
The project uses publicly available fake news datasets such as:

Fake and Real News Dataset
Or any custom dataset (details provided in the notebook).
Future Enhancements
Integration of deep learning models like LSTM and Transformer-based architectures (e.g., BERT).
Real-time fake news detection API or web application.
Incorporate multilingual support for detecting fake news across different languages.
